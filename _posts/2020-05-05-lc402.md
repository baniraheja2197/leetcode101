## Approach 1: Naive approach (TLE)
We want to get the lowest number possible by removing "k" digits. Whenever we find a number Y to the right of a number X such that Y < X, we would benefit from deleting X as Y would then occupy it's location resulting in a smaller number. Consider the number "213". Here, 1 is to the adjacent right of 2 and it is smaller than 2. If we delete 2, we get a smaller number "13" (if we had deleted 1 instead, we would have gotten "23". Clearly, 13 is less than 23).  
We can simply repeat this procedure k times to get our answer. Note that if we get a number like "12345" or "1123" where no adjacent right digit is greater than the previous digit, we would always benefit from deleting the largest number.

```
string removeKdigits(string num, int k) {
    while (k > 0) {
        int n = num.size();
        int i = 0;
        while (i+1<n && num[i]<=num[i+1])  i++;
        num.erase(i, 1);
        k--;
    }
    // trim leading zeros
    int s = 0;
    while (s<(int)num.size()-1 && num[s]=='0')  s++;
    num.erase(0, s);

    return num=="" ? "0" : num;
}
```
Time complexity: O(n*k) where n is the size of num

Note that this approach will give TLE.

## Approach 2: Greedy
The idea of this approach remains same. We will instead use a stack to make the algorithm linear in time. Algorithm:
1. Go through the number from left to right inserting the digits into a stack. The stack always maintains a non-decreasing order.
2. Whenever we encounter a digit, pop the digits from stack which are greater than that digit (note that this way stack always maintains non-decreasing order). This is because a number on the left is larger than the current number so we should remove such numbers. Also, do not forget to decrement k as we pop from the stack.
3. After iterating the whole string, we have to deal with edge cases like "1111" or "1234". These arise when the stack still has elements and k is still not 0. Since the stack maintains non-decreasing order, we just have to pop some elements from the stack (as largest element will be on top of stack).
4. Surprisingly, there is still one annoying edge case remaining. The resulting string may have leading zeros which we have to remove before returning the string.


The below code is a bit long but the idea is not complex.
```
class Solution {
public:
    string removeKdigits(string num, int k) {
        if (k>=num.length())
            return "0";

        stack<char> st;

        for (char c : num) {
            // k keeps track of how many characters we can remove
            // if the previous character in stk is larger than the current one
            // then removing it will get a smaller number
            // but we can only do so when k is larger than 0
            while (k>0 && !st.empty() && st.top()>c) {
                st.pop();
                k--;
            }
            st.push(c);
        }

        // edge cases like "1111", "12345"
        while (k-->0) st.pop();

        string res="";
        while (!st.empty()) {
            res+=st.top();
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());

        // remove leading zeros if any (coonsider case num="100", k=1)
        auto idx = res.length()-1;
        for (int i=0; i<res.length(); i++) {
            if (res[i]=='0') continue;
            idx=i;
            break;
        }
        res = res.substr(idx);

        return res;
    }
};
```
Time complexity: O(n)


The code above can be made shorter. Instead of a stack, we can use the answer string itself. Strings in C++ behave just like a vector of characters so they have the `pop_back` function which we can leverage to simulate stack behavior.

```
string removeKdigits(string num, int k) {
    string ans = "";                                         // treat ans as a stack in below for loop

    for (char c : num) {
        while (ans.length() && ans.back() > c && k) {
            ans.pop_back();                                  // make sure digits in ans are in ascending order
            k--;                                             // remove one char
        }

        if (ans.length() || c != '0') { ans.push_back(c); }  // can't have leading '0'
    }

    while (ans.length() && k--) { ans.pop_back(); }          // make sure remove k digits in total

    return ans.empty() ? "0" : ans;
}
```
