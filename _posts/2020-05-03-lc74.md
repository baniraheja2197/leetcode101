title: LC 74. Search a 2D Matrix

If you were to imagine the 2D Matrix as a 1D array instead, clearly it would be sorted in the ascending order as per the conditions. This is because each row is sorted in ascending order and the first element of a row is larger than the last element of the previous row. See below:
```
[1,   3,  5,  7]
[10, 11, 16, 20]   ---> [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 16, 20, 23, 30, 34, 50]
[23, 30, 34, 50]
```

We know that we can apply binary search in a 1D array and it takes up O(lg n) time. All we have to do here is to somehow map the indices of the 2D array into the index of a 1D array.

* n * m matrix convert to an array => matrix[x][y] => a[x * m + y]
* an array convert to n * m matrix => a[x] => matrix[x / m][x % m];

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        if (matrix.size() == 0)
            return false;
        
        int rows = matrix.size(), cols = matrix[0].size();
        int l = 0, r = rows*cols-1;
        
        while (l<=r) {
            int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            int x = mid/cols, y = mid%cols;
            
            if (matrix[x][y] == target)
                return true;
            
            if (matrix[x][y] > target)
                r = mid-1;
            else
                l = mid+1;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
Time complexity: O(lg(n*m)) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns  
Space complexity: O(1)
