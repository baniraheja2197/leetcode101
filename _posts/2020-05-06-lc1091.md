The idea is to perform a BFS from the position {0,0} to position {n-1,n-1}. We could also perform a DFS but note that BFS always gives us the shortest path so BFS is preferred. The code below is easy to understand and is the standard approach for BFS.

```
int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    if (graph[0][0])
        return -1;

    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    int n = graph.size();
    q.push({0,0});
    int level = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        level++;
        int sz = q.size();

        while (sz--) {
            auto c = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (c.first == n - 1 && c.second == n - 1) return level;

            // check all 8 directions
            for (auto i = c.first - 1; i <= c.first + 1; ++i)
                for (auto j = c.second - 1; j <= c.second + 1; ++j)
                    if (i == c.first && j == c.second) continue;

                    if (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < n && j < n && !graph[i][j]) {
                        q.push({ i, j });
                        graph[i][j] = 1; // this is our way of marking the node as visited as we always check that it is 0 before adding it to the queue
                    }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```
