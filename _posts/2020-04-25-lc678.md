## Approach 1: Using stack
An asterisk (*) can be replaced by any any of the following: left parenthesis `(`, right parenthesis `)`, or empty string. Let us iterate the string and store occurrences of all left parenthesis `(` and asterisks `*`. When we encounter a right parenthesis, we have to consider the following cases:
1. Stack is empty: this means there is no `(` or `*` on the left of the parenthesis so the string is mismatched.
2. Stack is not empty: this means there is either `(` or `*` on the left. We search for the top most `(` in the stack and pop it. If there is no `(`, we consider the rightmost `*` to be a left parenthesis and pop it from the stack. This way, we only use an `*` when an opening parenthesis cannot match a closing parenthesis.

This ensures that when we iterate through the whole string, our stack only contains `(` and `*`. Now, there is still one possibility where the string may be mismatched. Consider the string "**(()". Our stack will contain `*, *, (` after iterating the whole string. We cannot replace the asterisks `*` by anything to make the string valid! This is because the left parenthesis occur after the asterisks. Specifically, we have to handle the case where there is **no** asterisk on the right of a left parenthesis.  
We do this by keeping an asterisks count while popping the stack. If we encounter a left parenthesis and the asterisks count is < 0, we know that the string is invalid.

public:
    bool checkValidString(string s) {
        stack<int> st, st1;
        
        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '(' || s[i] == '*')
                st.push(s[i]);
            else
                if (st.empty())
                    return false;
                else {
                    while (!st.empty() && st.top() == '*') { // find the rightmost occurrence of a left-parenthesis
                        st1.push(st.top());
                        st.pop();
                    }
                    
                    if (st.empty()) // no left-parenthesis found, pop an asterisk
                        st1.pop();
                    else // pop left parenthesis
                        st.pop();
                    
                    while (!st1.empty()) { // put back the asterisks in the main stack
                        st.push(st1.top());
                        st1.pop();
                    }
                }
        }
        
        int sc = 0; // asterisks count
        char c;
        
        while (!st.empty()) {
            c = st.top();
            st.pop();
            
            if (c=='*')
                sc++;
            else {
                if (sc>0) // there is an asterisk on the right of left-parenthesis
                    sc--;
                else // no asterisk on the right of left parenthesis
                    return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};

## Approach 2: Constance space
Solution by [@sansi](https://leetcode.com/sansi).

Let us keep track of two variables: "minimum net open parenthesis" (minOpen) and "maximum net open parenthesis" (maxOpen) while iterating the string. When we encounter an asterisk (*), it can act like an opening parenthesis, closing parenthesis or an empty string. To calculate minOpen, we consider * to be a closed parenthesis so that `minOpen = minOpen - 1`. To calculate maxOpen, we consider * to be an open parenthesis so that `maxOpen = maxOpen + 1`.

Let us understand why we are keeping track of these variables. Consider the string "(**())". Let us iterate character by character:
```
1. `(`: minOpen = 1, maxOpen = 1
2. `*`: Now, the string can become `()` or `(` or `((`. So net opening parenthesis can be 0, 1 or 2. Notice that this the range [minOpen, maxOpen] where minOpen=0 and maxOpen=1.
3. `*`: For each case in step 2, we can diverge the string into 3 cases again. minOpen = -1 and maxOpen = 3. You will notice that these strings will have net opening bracket in the range [minOpen, maxOpen]. For example, strings with opening parenthesis = 1 would be "(" or "()(" or "(()". Since minOpen = -1 does not make sense to us, we will discard those strings and keep minOpen = 0.
4. `(`: minOpen = 1, maxOpen = 4
5. `)`: minOpen = 0, maxOpen = 3
6. `)`: minOpen = 0 (discarding strings with minOpen = -1), maxOpen = 2
```

When do we know a string is invalid?  
A string is clearly invalid when maxOpen goes below zero while iterating the string (that means all routes have more `)` than `(` --> all routes are invalid --> stop and return false) **OR** minOpen is not equal to zero after we finish iterating the string.

```
public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
		int low = 0; // low is minOpen
		int high = 0; // high is maxOpen
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
				if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
						low++;
						high++;
				} else if (s.charAt(i) == ')') {
						if (low > 0) {
								low--;
						}
						high--;
				} else {
						if (low > 0) {
								low--;
						}
						high++;
				}
				if (high < 0) {
						return false;
				}
		}
		return low == 0;
}
```
