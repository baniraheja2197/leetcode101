We can solve the problem by finding the minimum possible sum of numbers which are of the form 3n+1 (call it n1) and minimum possible sum of numbers 3n+2 (call it n2). Suppose the total sum of the numbers is `totSum`. Consider three cases:
1. `totSum%3 = 0`: Our answer is totSum
2. `totSum%3 = 1`: Our answer is totSum-n1
3. `totSum%3 = 2`: Our answer is totSum-n2

The trick lies in finding n1 and n2. At first, you may think that n1 is just the smallest number in the array, say x, such that x%3 = 1 and n2 is the smallest number in the array, say y, such that y%3 = 2. Consider this array: [2, 2, 3]. Here, according to our definition, n1 is not found and n2 = 2. Now, totSum=7 so totSum%3 = 1. What do we do now??

As it turns out, the definition for n1 and n2 are not correct. Consider two number, x and y, where x%3 = 2 and y%3 = 2. Clearly, (x+y)%3 = (x%3 + y%3)%3 = 1. So in the above example, while there is no single number of type 3n+1, the two number 2 and 2 make up to be n1. So the largest sum divisible by 3 would be 7-(2+2)=3.  
Similarly, if x%3=1 and y%3=1, (x+y)%3 = 2.

The approach is to iterate the array and keep track of n1 and n2. For each number k in array, if k%3 = 1, we do `n2 = min(n2, n1+k)` and `n1=min(n1, k)`. If k%3 = 2, we do `n1=min(n1, n2+k)` and `n2=min(n2, k)`.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumDivThree(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n1=10001, n2=10001, totSum=0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            totSum += i;

            if (i%3 == 1) {
                n2 = min(n2, n1+i);
                n1 = min(n1, i);
            }
            if (i%3 == 2) {
                n1 = min(n1, n2+i);
                n2 = min(n2, i);
            }
        }

        if (totSum%3 == 0)
            return totSum;
        else if (totSum%3 == 1)
            return totSum-n1;
        return totSum-n2;
    }
};
```
