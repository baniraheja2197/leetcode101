title: 1027. Longest Arithmetic Sequence

The problem is pretty similar to the standard [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/) DP problem so it's easy to guess that this can be solved with DP as well. Define dp[i][j] as longest arithmetic sequence ending at index i having a difference j. Clearly, to find values of dp[i], we iterate from i-1 to 0 (say the iterator is k) and take difference of A[i] with A[k], say `diff = A[i]-A[k]`. Hence, `dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[k][diff]+1)`.

The catch here is that how to implement this dp variable? Surely we could make a 2D array but the constraints `0 <= A[i] <= 10000` imply `-10000 <= diff <= 10000`. Creating a 2D array where each row is of size 20000 is a huge amount of space. And most of these differences won't even occur in the array so it's a huge waste as well. Instead, we will implement it as a map of map, as you will see below.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& A) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int,int>> dp;
        int res = 2;
        for (int i=0; i<A.size(); i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<i; j++) {
                int diff = A[i]-A[j];
                dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j][diff]==0 ? 2 : (dp[j][diff]+1));
                res = max(res, dp[i][diff]);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
