title: LC 1048. Longest String Chain

This question can be solved using a very straightforward dynamic programming approach:
- Sort the words by their lengths: you can either use the `sort()` function with a lambda comparator or do bucket sort
- Iterate through the list and for each word w, store the maximum length of string chain ending at this word in a map. To find the length chain for w, consider all the words by removing an alphabet from w and check if the new word, w', exists in the hash map. Programmatically, `dp[w] = max(dp[w], 1+dp[w'])` where w' are all the words derived by removing an alphabet from w.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(begin(words), end(words), [](string a, string b) {return a.size()<b.size();});

        unordered_map<string, int> dp;
        int res = 0;
        for (auto s : words) {
            for (int i=0; i<s.size(); i++)
                dp[s] = max(dp[s], 1+dp[s.substr(0, i) + s.substr(i+1)]);
            res = max(res, dp[s]);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
Time complexity: O(n*maxLen(w)). The TC depends on length of w because of the `substr()` function  
Space complexity: O(n)
