A BST iterator performs an inorder traversal of the tree step-by-step. The idea is to basically perform a controlled inorder traversal of the tree. If you are familiar with the iterative inorder traversal of a binary tree, solving this question should be straightforward. If you are not familiar with it, consider reading my solution of [LC 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://sarthak-sehgal.github.io/leetcode101/lc94).

Quoting from my solution for the iterative inorder traversal (link above):

*Starting from the given root node of the tree:*
1. Go as left as possible pushing the nodes in a stack (until the encountered nodeâ€™s left child is NULL).
2. Pop the node which is on top of the stack
3. Push the node to the answer and check:
    - if the node has a right child, push the right child to the stack and then go to step 1 (essentially we are now traversing the right subtree of the previous node as we have already visited the left subtree and also the root)
    - else repeat step 2

We can clearly use the same idea to solve this question. The code below uses the same approach, more commonly known as controlled inorder traversal.

```
class BSTIterator {
public:
    stack<TreeNode*> st;
    
    BSTIterator(TreeNode* root) {
        while (root) {
            st.push(root);
            root = root->left;
        }
    }
    
    /** @return the next smallest number */
    int next() {
        if (!hasNext()) return -1;
        
        TreeNode *t = st.top();
        st.pop();
        TreeNode* temp = t->right;
        while (temp) {
            st.push(temp);
            temp = temp->left;
        }
        
        return t->val;
    }
    
    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    bool hasNext() {
        if (st.empty()) return false;
        return true;
    }
};
```
Time complexity: next() has complexity O(h) where h is the height of tree, hasNext() has complexity O(1)  
Space complexity: O(h)
